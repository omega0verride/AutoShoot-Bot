# AutoShoot-Bot
## Use
Makes Pistols and DMRs shoot faster, almost like a full auto weapon.
You don't have to quickly press and release the mouse to shoot with a pistol. You just hold it down.

## Demo

## How it works
First you set a keyboard key as a shoot keybind on your game. In the demo above number '8' is set as shoot keybind in the game and in the bot.\
  Carefull! Numpad numbers and normal numbers are not the same.
The app detects when Mouse Left button is being held down.
It presses and releases the shoot key quickly making the game think you're clicking the shoot keybaind real fast.

## Downsides
In some games, like Rainbow 6 Siege you cannot place gadgets while the bot is active since you have to hold down the mouse.
